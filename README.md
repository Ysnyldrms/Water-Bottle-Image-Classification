# Water-Bottle-Image-Classification

### Project Objective

The main objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately classify water bottle images based on their water levels. The model will be trained on a dataset of water bottle images, with each image being labeled as Full water level, Half water level, or Overflowing. The goal is to develop a model that can accurately classify a given water bottle image based on its water level.

### Dataset Description

The dataset consists of water bottle images that have been classified based on the level of water inside the bottle. There are three categories of images: Full water level, Half water level, and Overflowing. Each category contains a number of images of water bottles with the corresponding water level. The purpose of the dataset is to be used for an image classification problem, where a machine learning model is trained to classify the water level of a given water bottle image.

The dataset is intended to be used for training and testing a machine learning model for image classification. The model will be trained on the provided images, with each image being labeled as either Full water level, Half water level, or Overflowing. The goal of the model is to accurately classify a given water bottle image based on its water level.

The dataset consists of a number of water bottle images, each of which has been classified based on the water level inside the bottle. The images in the Full water level category show water bottles with the maximum possible amount of water inside, while the images in the Half water level category show water bottles with roughly half the maximum amount of water inside. The images in the Overflowing category show water bottles with more water inside than the maximum capacity of the bottle, resulting in water spilling out.

The dataset is likely to be useful for a variety of applications, such as developing automated systems for monitoring and managing water levels in containers or for use in a general image classification problem. The dataset may also be useful for research purposes, as it allows for the development and testing of machine learning models for image classification tasks.
